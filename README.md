# ðŸŽ° Decentralized Lottery API â€“ Sui Chain

This project powers a decentralized lottery system built on the [Sui blockchain](https://sui.io). It indexes on-chain events into a PostgreSQL database via Prisma to provide fast, reliable access to lottery and ticket data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create and manage lotteries
- Buy tickets
- Set winners and handle withdrawals
- Fetch all lotteries and tickets
- Withdraw prize and commission funds
- Syncs blockchain events into an off-chain DB

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Framework:** NestJS
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Blockchain:** Sui
- **Event Syncing:** Off-chain indexing from on-chain events

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All time values should be passed as UNIX timestamps in milliseconds.
- Data consistency is maintained by indexing on-chain events like lottery creation, ticket purchases, and winner declarations into the database.
- Designed to support real-time UX without querying the chain directly every time.
